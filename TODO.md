* JSDOC
* Improve the UI for insert, update, delete
 * various data types
* Create a tab showing all the tables and columns
* Migrate to use http://hiddentao.github.com/squel/

#Later
* Bugs: * Race condition: remove after insert fails cause insert didn't finish
* How do we deal with large number of rows. We don't want to insert a huge number of rows 
* Don't create tables, triggers, etc automatically each time?
